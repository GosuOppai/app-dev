# One piece
**The story begins with the execution of Gol D. Roger, the King of the Pirates, who reveals the existence of his treasure, the One Piece, before his death. This announcement sparks the Great Pirate Era, leading countless pirates to set sail in search of Roger's treasure. Twenty-two years later, we meet Monkey D. Luffy, a young boy who dreams of becoming a pirate. After accidentally eating a Devil Fruit, he gains the ability to stretch his body like rubber but loses the ability to swim.** 🏴‍☠️
